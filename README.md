- Organized sections for education, experience, publications, projects, and skills
- Responsive design for web and mobile
- Clean and printable with no JavaScript or external libraries
- Easy to update and maintain with well-commented code

## File Structure

.
├── index.html # Main HTML file containing CV content
├── style.css # CSS file defining the look and layout
└── README.md # Documentation for the project


## How to Use

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the CV.
3. Customize `index.html` with your own:
   - Contact details
   - Educational background
   - Work and research experience
   - Skills and achievements
   - Publications and academic contributions
4. Update `index.css` to personalize the visual style, typography, or layout if needed.
5. Use your browser's **Print** or **Save as PDF** feature to export a printable version.

## Customization Tips

- Use `<section>` elements to organize different parts of your CV.
- Maintain a clear hierarchy using headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) and lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`).
- Keep the CSS modular and separated by section for easier adjustments.
- Consider adding print-specific styles using `@media print` in the CSS for optimal PDF formatting.
